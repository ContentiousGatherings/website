I primarily study urban histories of gender, sexuality and social movements.
Among other things, militant antifascism in the Öresund region c. 1985-2013,
youth riots in Stockholm c. 1948-1987 and the policing of homosexuality
in Stockholm in the 1950s.

In this project work with the theoretical frame, historical analysis of
the database and qualitative case studies of urban forms of collective actions.
