::: { style="font-size: 125%;" }

I am a historian with a PhD from Lund university. My main research topics are
political radicalism, popular protest, and repertoires of contention in
Swedish 19th and early 20th century. I’m particularly interested in
understanding Sweden’s late democratization and the birth of modern,
democratic political culture in Sweden.

I am the PI of The Contentious Swedes project.
